# Svelte SEO Component

This is a component which can be used to set common meta tags in the <code>head</code> of pages in a Svelte app.

You can set a default title, description, and image in the component itself. When using the component. It is recommended to always pass <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> as props to avoid duplicate titles and metadescriptions. These props will set title & description meta tags, as well as associated Open Graph & Twitter tags.

This component also accepts Open Graph- & Twitter-specific props that will override the generic <code>title</code> and <code>description</code> values if passed.

The logic of the component assumes that the default value for <code>image</code> and <code>alt</code> are set for a global default sharing image.

If you really wanted to, you could have different titles, descriptions, and images for Search Engines, Facebook, and Twitter ðŸ¤·

Here's an example of how the component could be used:

```svelte
<SEO
	title="Manually Set Title | Website Name"
	ogTitle="Facebook Title | Website Name"
	twitterTitle="Twitter Title | Website Name"
	description="I'm a manually set meta description."
	ogDescription="I will override the og:description tag."
	twitterDescription="I will override the twitter:description tag."
	image="/iWillSetOgAndTwitterImageTags.jpg"
    ogImage="/iWillOverrideOgImageTag.jpg"
	twitterImage="/iWillOverrideTwitterImageTag.jpg"
	slug="/"
/>
```
